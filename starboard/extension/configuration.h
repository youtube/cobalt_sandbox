  // The following set of parameters define how much memory is reserved for

  //
  // The sum of the following caches effectively describes the maximum GPU
  // texture memory usage (though it doesn't consider video textures and
  // display color buffers):
  //   - CobaltSkiaCacheSizeInBytes (GLES2 rasterizer only)
  //   - CobaltImageCacheSizeInBytes
  //   - CobaltSkiaGlyphAtlasWidth * CobaltSkiaGlyphAtlasHeight
  //
  // The other caches affect CPU memory usage.

  // Determines the capacity of the skia cache.  The Skia cache is maintained
  // within Skia and is used to cache the results of complicated effects such
  // as shadows, so that Skia draw calls that are used repeatedly across
  // frames can be cached into surfaces.  This setting is only relevant when
  // using the hardware-accelerated Skia rasterizer.
  int (*CobaltSkiaCacheSizeInBytes)();

  // Determines the amount of GPU memory the offscreen target atlases will
  // use. This is specific to the direct-GLES rasterizer and caches any render
  // tree nodes which require skia for rendering. Two atlases will be allocated
  // from this memory or multiple atlases of the frame size if the limit
  // allows. It is recommended that enough memory be reserved for two RGBA
  // atlases about a quarter of the frame size.
  int (*CobaltOffscreenTargetCacheSizeInBytes)();

  // Determines the capacity of the encoded image cache, which manages encoded
  // images downloaded from a web page. These images are cached within CPU
  // memory.  This not only reduces network traffic to download the encoded
  // images, but also allows the downloaded images to be held during suspend.
  // Note that there is also a cache for the decoded images whose capacity is
  // specified in |CobaltImageCacheSizeInBytes|.  The decoded images are often
  // cached in the GPU memory and will be released during suspend.
  //
  // If a system meets the following requirements:
  // 1. Has a fast image decoder.
  // 2. Has enough CPU memory, or has a unified memory architecture that allows
  //    sharing of CPU and GPU memory.
  // Then it may consider implementing |CobaltEncodedImageCacheSizeInBytes| to
  // return a much bigger value, and set the return value of
  // |CobaltImageCacheSizeInBytes| to a much smaller value. This allows the app
  // to cache significantly more images.
  //
  // Setting this to 0 can disable the cache completely.

  // reached, further requests are handled via file stream.

  //                    generally faster on the CPU and GPU. This can handle
  //                    360 rendering.
  //   'hardware'    -- As much hardware acceleration of graphics commands as
  //                    possible. This uses skia to wrap OpenGL ES commands.
  //                    Required for 360 rendering.
